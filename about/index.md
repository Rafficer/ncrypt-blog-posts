## About blog.ncrypt.sh

[blog.ncrypt.sh](https://blog.ncrypt.sh) is a blog with mostly guides on various topics, where I thought they'd be nice to have and could help out others. Since guides often get old and unusable over the years, it would be great to have the option (as a reader) to submit changes to keep them up to date. This way the Author (me) just needs to accept the **Pull Request** and the website gets updated automatically.

## Collaboration

All [blog posts](https://blog.ncrypt.sh/posts) are hosted in a [Github Repository](https://github.com/Rafficer/ncrypt-blog-posts), where anyone can submit a **Pull Request** to update outdated information, fix typos or generally improve a post.
