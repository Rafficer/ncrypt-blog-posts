## What it is

[blog.ncrypt.sh](https://blog.ncrypt.sh) is a blog with mostly guides on various topics, where I thought it'd by nice to have and might help out others. Since guides often get old and unusable over the years, it would be great to have the option (as a reader) to submit changes to keep them up to date. This way the Author (me) just needs to accept the Pull Request and the website gets updated automatically.

## How it works

1. Found a post that should be updated?
2. Fork this repository
3. Edit the markdown file of the post in the `posts` directory of this repository
4. Commit your changes to your fork of the repository
5. Submit a Pull Request for these changes
6. Wait for the PR to be approved. The changes will then be live with the next server update.

No idea how all of this works? Check out the [first-contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) repository for an extensive and easy to understand step-by-step guide.

## Images

Think something is wrong with an image in a post? With the current structure I couldn't put the image directory in this repository. Therefore, please submit the images in an issue or PR and I'll add them manually.
